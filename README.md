# fetch-joke-app
In this assignment, I built a simple web application that fetches and displays random jokes from an external API. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I created a user-friendly interface where users can click a button to retrieve a new joke each time. The application leverages the Fetch API for asynchronous data fetching and includes responsive styling for an engaging user experience.
